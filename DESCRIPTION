Description: Simple git client based on 'libgit2' with
    user-friendly authentication and support for both SSH and HTTPS
    remotes on all platforms. User credentials are shared with command
    line 'git' through the git-credential store and ssh keys stored on
    disk or ssh-agent. On Linux, a somewhat recent version of 'libgit2' is
    required.
