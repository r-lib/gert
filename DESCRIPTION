Description: Simple git client for R based on 'libgit2' with support for SSH and 
    HTTPS remotes. All functions in gert use basic R data types (such as vectors
    and data-frames) for their arguments and return values. User credentials are
    shared with command line 'git' through the git-credential store and ssh keys
    stored on disk or ssh-agent. On Linux, a somewhat recent version of 'libgit2'
    is required; we provide a PPA for older Ubuntu LTS versions.
