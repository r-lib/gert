Description: Simple git client for R based on 'libgit2' <https://libgit2.org> with
    support for SSH and HTTPS remotes. All functions in 'gert' use basic R data 
    types (such as vectors and data-frames) for their arguments and return values.
    User credentials are shared with command line 'git' through the git-credential
    store and ssh keys stored on disk or ssh-agent.
